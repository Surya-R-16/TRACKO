App Overview
A personal expense tracking app that reads UPI transaction SMS messages, allows manual categorization of payments, and provides spending analytics.
Core Features & Implementation Details
1. SMS Reading & Parsing System
SMS Permission & Access:

Request READ_SMS permission from user
Read all SMS messages from inbox
Filter messages from known sources (banks, payment apps)
Common senders: "HDFC", "SBI", "GPAY", "PHONEPE", "PAYTM", "AMAZON PAY", etc.

Transaction Detection Logic:

Parse SMS text for transaction keywords: "paid", "debited", "sent", "transferred"
Extract key information using regex patterns:

Amount: ₹100, Rs.500, INR 1000 formats
Recipient: UPI ID, phone number, merchant name
Date/Time: from SMS timestamp
Transaction ID: if present
Payment method: UPI, debit card, etc.



Data Extraction Examples:
SMS: "₹150 paid to 9876543210 via UPI. UPI Ref: 123456789"
Extract: Amount=150, Recipient=9876543210, Method=UPI, Ref=123456789

SMS: "Rs.500 debited from account ending 1234 at ZOMATO"
Extract: Amount=500, Merchant=ZOMATO, Method=Card
2. Transaction Storage System
Local Database Schema:
sqlCREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    amount REAL,
    recipient TEXT,
    merchant_name TEXT,
    date_time TEXT,
    transaction_id TEXT,
    payment_method TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    is_categorized BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    sms_content TEXT
);
Transaction Processing:

Store all parsed transactions in local SQLite database
Flag transactions as "categorized" or "uncategorized"
Handle duplicate detection (same amount, recipient, within 5 minutes)
Store original SMS content for reference

3. Categorization System
Default Categories:

Food & Dining
Transportation
Shopping
Entertainment
Bills & Utilities
Health & Medical
Education
Personal Care
Other

Manual Categorization Interface:

Show list of uncategorized transactions
Display: Amount, Recipient, Date, Original SMS
Quick category buttons for each transaction
Option to add custom notes
Bulk categorization for similar transactions

Smart Suggestions (Optional Enhancement):

Learn from user patterns
Suggest categories based on amount ranges
Suggest based on time of day (morning = breakfast, evening = dinner)
Remember merchant mappings (9876543210 = bike taxi)
